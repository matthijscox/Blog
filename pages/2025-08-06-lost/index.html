<p>I feel a little lost, without a goal, no real drive or ambition. This is a rare feeling for me, typically I have some goal I am chasing. This feeling hits me most at work. At home it&#39;s okay. There I just do whatever I feel like doing, like reading books or doing activities with the family. But at work I feel lost. Normally I have a clear goal. Either striving for excellence in my main project, or chasing a side-project, or building tools for others. I optimized for <a href="../2021-05-04-developer-freedom">freedom</a> so much that it&#39;s turning on me now that I have no clear direction.</p>
<p>Should I look for a new &#40;career&#41; goal to chase? I am actually reluctant. Having a goal tends to make me a little obsessive while chasing it. At first this feels nice, given you a sense of purpose. But long term it always turns into a tense situation, draining the fun out of it, making myself suffer in order to succeed. I want to stay mentally healthy and this conflicts with indulging any compulsions.</p>
<p>I could choose a goal and hold it lightly? Go after it, but enjoy the journey? It doesn&#39;t matter if I reach the goal or not. I can try not to care if progress is slow or inaccurate. Do I have that in me? It&#39;s not really a goal if I don&#39;t care about reaching it. It&#39;s more like a vague direction to move in.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll try, but so far it comes with this dreaded feeling. It&#39;s a package deal at the moment. Being goalless, wandering a bit in some direction, comes with feeling lost. Perhaps the goal is to just feel that feeling for a while. Until I can accept it. </p>
<p>It&#39;s not that I am without purpose or meaning. Being lost doesn&#39;t turn you into a nihilist. Life has meaning, being lost has meaning. It&#39;s just uncomfortable.</p>
<p>So. I tried to deal with it by blogging/journaling. Get it out of my system. Doesn&#39;t really work either, but it&#39;s time to get back to work and find something to do.</p>
