# Scientific Coder

I am moving my professional content off this private blog and onto [scientificcoder.com](https://scientificcoder.com/). This way I can keep my weird philosophies separate from my work. Also I might want to bundle my professional stories into a book one day.

The benefit of the new blog is that it has a newsletter you can subscribe to. I love this little static Franklin.jl (Jekyll based) website I have here, but it's a bit tedious to work with (especially when writing on mobile) and difficult to add all these modern features.

If you are a computational scientist or software developer, I hope to see you on The Scientific Coder! If not, feel free to stay on this blog. Functional Noise has an [RSS feed](https://www.functionalnoise.com/feed.xml) that you can subscribe to, if you know how.
