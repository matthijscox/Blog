# Biosignal Machine Learning

In a [previous entrepreneurial project](https://medium.com/symbionic-project) I’ve spend more than a year struggling to build an affordable gesture detection application. The idea was to help amputees get more affordable bionic arms and rehabilitation. I restarted the project from scratch in a fraction of the time by switching the software stack to Julia and [BrainFlow](https://github.com/brainflow-dev/brainflow).

In essence, this side-project is all about using non-conventional body signals to control the physical and digital world. It fascinates me and many others. The easiest thing to control is a video game on your laptop. So that’s what I am aiming for. Here’s what the end result looks like:

I estimate it took me about 40 hours, because I spend a month working on it with only 30-60 minutes per evening. I admit that if you try it yourself, then it may take longer. I already did all the work before in Python, so I didn't have to research anything. I could reuse all my past experience and just copy the work to another implementation.

## Data Visualization

To do: copy the rest
