<p>This feeling. I first encountered it during meditation, about 9 months ago. A special kind of suffering that I could not shake. I thought it was somekind of absolute feeling of meaninglessness. But I am not sure now.</p>
<p>After I felt it, I think I have been fleeing it ever since. I frantically started new side projects that felt more meaningful, so it has been a potent force in that regard. But my energy is too low now. I could still distact my mind a bit with entertainment, numb the feeling, but it&#39;s not enough anymore.</p>
<p>It has caught up with me. It&#39;s here now as I write this, close to the surface. I feel it in all my muscles as some kind of urge to move, to run away. I can&#39;t really describe it. It&#39;s not boredom. I feel like running away from everything, from work, from my family. I&#39;m pretty certain that won&#39;t help. I don&#39;t know how to get rid of it.</p>
<p>I still don&#39;t know how to <a href="https://nav.al/kapil">conquer my mind</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll try excercising this evening.</p>
<p>&#61;&#61;&#61;</p>
<p>Better. For now. I cycled as fast as I could and summoned this feeling. Perhaps my body is just telling me to freaking excercise more. My mind feels quite clear now, like a fog has lifted. I hope this is the end of my <a href="https://www.functionalnoise.com/pages/2021-06-04-mind-decay/">mind decay</a> episode.</p>
