# Why a blog?

Writing a blog is good for clearing my thoughts. I'd like to get those ideas out of my mental pipeline, before it clogging it up. A public website will generate just enough anxiety to force me to write them down more clearly. This may help me reflect on my thoughts, see changes in ideas and habits, and perhaps improve myself over time.

The blog is written with [Franklin.jl](https://franklinjl.org/), which helps me write (Julia) code whenever I want to:
```julia
abstract type AbstractPoint end
struct XYPoint{T<:Real} <: AbstractPoint
    x::T
    y::T
end
```
