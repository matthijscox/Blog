# Why a blog?

Writing a blog is good for clearing my thoughts. I'd like to get those ideas out of my mental pipeline, before it clogs up. A public website will generate just enough anxiety to force me to write them down more clearly. This may help me reflect on my thoughts, see changes in ideas and habits, and perhaps improve myself over time.

Many of my beliefs and thoughts may turn out wrong. The point is to become less wrong. Generating some noise may actually be beneficial for that. Noise is an inherent part of our universe, with our senses and brain we try to find signals within it. But noise can also help to regularize learning algorithms, help them avoid some overfitting.

A colleague once mentioned that I am [Chaotic Good](http://easydamus.com/chaoticgood.html). I agree. So that's what functional noise is.

The blog is written with [Franklin.jl](https://franklinjl.org/), which helps me write (Julia) code whenever I want to:
```julia
abstract type AbstractPoint end
struct XYPoint{T<:Real} <: AbstractPoint
    x::T
    y::T
end
```
