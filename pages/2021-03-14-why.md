# Why a blog?

Writing a blog is good for clearing my thoughts. I'd like to get those ideas out of my mental pipeline, before it clogs up. A public website will generate just enough anxiety for me to write my ideas down more clearly. This may help me reflect on my thoughts, observe changes in my beliefs and habits and thereby hopefully improve myself over time.

Many of my beliefs and thoughts may turn out wrong. The point is simply to become less wrong. Generating some noise may actually be beneficial for that. Noise is an inherent part of our universe. With our senses and brain we try to find signals within it. We often consider noise as a disadvantage, but noise can also help to regularize our learning, make sure you don't take ideas and beliefs for granted. Functional noise makes us [Antifragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile).

A colleague once mentioned that I am [Chaotic Good](http://easydamus.com/chaoticgood.html). I looked it up and I agree. I think generating functional noise is a great tool for us chaotically-good-aligned-entities.

Also, all other cool domain names I came up with were already taken. Selection effects are powerful.

The blog itself is written with [Franklin.jl](https://franklinjl.org/), which helps me write (Julia) code whenever I want to:
```julia
abstract type AbstractPoint end
struct XYPoint{T<:Real} <: AbstractPoint
    x::T
    y::T
end
```
So far Julia has helped me reduce some internal suffering (damnit, why can't I code in a language that is both easy and fast?!). It has added some noise to the world (oh no, [yet another programming language](https://xkcd.com/927/)), but I believe it will be worth it.

If you found this blog, it's probably random. Or maybe only my future self will read this. That's fine.

## How to blog?

Some people have asked me: "where do you find the time for all this?". I have a fulltime job,
