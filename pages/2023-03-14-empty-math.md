# The Mathematics of Emptiness


The Buddhist concept of Emptiness is shrouded in mystery. You have to experience it to understand it. It's ineffable.

<Insert some quotes>

Nah, I am not having it. A few thousand years have passed and we have better tools. Let's describe it with math. We need enlightened mathematicians.

Warning: I am a physicist, not a mathematician, so I do everything handwavy. Mathematics is a [language of our perception](https://perceptualoriginsofmath.wordpress.com/chapter-1/), so we should be able to describe some of the concepts somewhat with it.


## Space of awareness


Let's use some set theory for my mathematics of emptiness.

At any moment you hold many objects in your awareness. Physical objects or mental concepts. A tree, a cat, a thought about work, time, space, any thing. Anything your mind can hold.

Let's say you are aware of object X. Then you are also aware of not-X, since X is surrounded by everything else. 

I claim there are only two states possible here:
- You are aware of X and ¬X
- You are unaware of X and ¬X
So awareness is either (X U ¬X) or ¬(X U ¬X).

Basically objects can enter and leave awareness. You are currently unaware of the cat concept. But then a cat enters your awareness. You are currently unaware of the flabodoodle device, which will maybe be invented in the future.

I claim that emptiness is this property of concepts to move in and out of awareness. When a concept is outside awareness, it simply does not exist anymore. From the point of view of your mind there is absolutely nothing outside your awareness.

Your awareness has the set of all known objects. Objects can be added and removed from this set. If you are aware of this changeability in objects, their 'illusionary' nature, than emptiness is an object in awareness. Emptiness itself is empty ofcourse, it can move out of awareness. The concept of this set of objects can also be in the set of objects. The entire set of objects cannot be in the set itself, you cannot actually 'see' awareness itself.

The set of all known objects needs to have some order or structure, else objects sit on top of each other and cannot be discriminated from one another. This is the feeling of physical and mental space. Space is a fascinating concept. Empty space is also an object in awareness. The absence of space is nothing, no-thing, no thing.

So space arranges all objects. Typically we just say that space contains objects. Lots of objects/concepts do actually overlap in space. When someone talks, their body and their voice seem to originate from the same point in space. This 'binding' of objects in the same space fascinates some (insert link to QRI talk).

(As a fun excercise, try to find the edge of space in your experience. You cannot.)

Nothing contains no objects. It's where all the objects go when they leave your awareness. Nothingness has a lot of potential.

So we could say that:
- Space is (X U ¬X)
- Nothingness is ¬(X U ¬X).

Impermanence is the concept that objects move around in space and move in and out of awareness. 


## Imaginary Plane of Conciousness


For a while people thought that the square root of negative numbers did not exist. And it's true... in the space of real numbers. But someone just relabeled sqrt (-1) and called it _i_. Boom, done. Turns out the Buddhist were way ahead of the mathematicians. 

Let's define nothingness as orthogonal to space. Nothingness is the imaginary dimension of awareness, it can contain infinite concepts. Space is the real dimension of awareness, due to the limits of our mind it will contain a finite amount of concepts. You can draw a plane of these two dimensions. The imaginary plane of conciousness.

A concept can move through the imaginary plane, that's impermanence. Emptiness is knowing that objects have this imaginary property, even if you cannot actually see the imaginary component.


## Holographic Compositionality

Concepts or objects typically feel like they have other concepts inside as parts. This is a weird kind of holographic property of space. Let me elaborate.

You look at a car. The car fills a part of space. You look at it's wheel. It feels like the wheel fills a part of the space where the car concept is. So now you have two concepts laying on top of each other in space. The wheel will consists of many parts, a rubber tire, nuts and bolts. Those contain parts as well. So concepts can overlay recursively inside the same space. It is as if a lot of holograms cover the same space.

The car concept itself is not actually made of the compositional concepts. This follows from the ship of Theseus reasoning, or the seven point chariot. The car concept stands singularly on it's own.

The parts that you consider as part of the car will vary over time. The more you look, the more parts you find inside the space contained by the car. This is another form of impermanence.


## Emptiness of mathematics


All the above is empty. Space is empty. The imaginary plane is empty. Every concept in awareness is empty. The math is empty. Emptiness is empty.
